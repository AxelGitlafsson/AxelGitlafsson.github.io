I’m a Computer Science Master’s graduate from the University of Bath, specializing in data science and machine learning. With a Bachelor’s in Psychology, I bring a unique, multidisciplinary skillset to the table; to which I credit my strong statistical foundation and my ability to efficiently research new topics and scientific concepts.

My Master’s thesis explored the “hot hand” effect in NBA basketball, developing ML models to investigate streaks of hot shooting. This project, which earned top marks, deepened my passion for applying data science to real-world problems. I further honed my skills during an internship at BlazeSQL, an AI-powered data analytics company, where I analyzed errors in LLM-generated SQL queries, identifying patterns, and presenting insights to enhance the model's performance.

Proficient in Python, my skills are in machine learning, statistical analysis and data visualization. I approach challenges with creativity and a commitment to continuous learning. Outside of work, I’m an avid basketball player and a stats nerd, often debating game analytics with friends.

I highly value personal development and thrive in workplaces that foster continuous learning and offer challenging problems. I’m excited to contribute my skills to innovative  projects. Please feel free to reach out to me!
